# Labyrinth: Add a Door

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game more interesting, please add a place which can only be entered if something else was done before,
e.g. a door with a key to find, a troll and a meal to prepare, a river and a boat to build, ... .

Requirements:
- Create a picture for the item you need (door)
- Add a tile which fits to the item
- Add the behavior of the tile to the [tiles.js](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/tiles.js) file.
- The pictures MUST be your own work.
- Place tile and dependency into the labyrinth.

Expected Outcome:
- a merged pull request
- two tiles are added to the labyrinth
- the tiles are reachable

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
