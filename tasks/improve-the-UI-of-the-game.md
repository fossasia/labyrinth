# Labyrinth: Build/Improve the UI of the game

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To enable the game on many devices (Tablets, Phones, Laptop) and make it more beautiful, please improve the user interface.

Requirements:
- Add the basic UI elements (zoom in, zoom out, pan etc, reset, etc) to the game / Improve( in terms on compatibility, ease of access, solve bugs) if they already exist.
- Develop / Enhance the on-screen controls.

Expected Outcome:
- systematic (uniform) UI elements that match the overall design of the game.
- a merged pull request and resolved bug issues created from the pull request.

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
