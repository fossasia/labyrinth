# Labyrinth: Create a New Theme

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
Currently, we have the a theme of rooms and doors. There could be more themes of your imagination:
pipes, riffs in the sea, bridges, Minecraft, ...

This tasks takes several hours, maybe days. In the end you have an own labyrinth theme and a new level with it.


Requirements:
- Create an [issue](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/issues) for your theme and describe what you have in mind.
- Create tiles which can be used to go into every direction. Please say which these are.
  Many of them can be generated by mirroring.
  You do not need to create all of them, just enough to create labyrinths
  - dead ends: enter from top, bottom, left, right
  - ways: top-left, top-right, top-bottom, right-left, right-bottom, left-bottom
  - crossings: 4-way, top-bottom-left, top-right-left, top-right-bottom, right-bottom-left
- Create one or more pull requests to add these tiles.
- Create a new level or part of the labyrinth with the size of at least 5x5.

Expected outcome:
- The pull requests are merged and the issue is closed.
- All issues resulting from your pull-requests are resolved. This is important: You may create new issues and we tend to merge fast and allow several pull requests to be submitted for one issue

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
