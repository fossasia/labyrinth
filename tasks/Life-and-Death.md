# # Labyrinth: Add Life and Death to Labyrinth !!

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. I think in this game an element of `life` will play a great role in making it interesting !!

Requirements:
- Add a life bar (hearts)
- Add elements all over the labyrinth that can harm the player and so reducing its life
- After the element damages the player, a message describing the hit (e.g. the golem smashed the player, etc) 
- After death, a pop-up screen stating that the player has died !! 

Expected Outcome:
- A merged pull request
- Life bar added
- At least one element added that inflicts damage to the player
- At least three messages that describe the hit (which will be displayed to the player randomly)
- An after-death pop-up screen
- A working link that showcases the changes 

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
