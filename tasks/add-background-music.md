# Labyrinth: Add Background Music

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game more interesting, please add background music.

Requirements:
- Add background music eg: Recording of your favorite song. You can sing, play an instrument (guitar, piano)
  or compose your own music.
- Add it to the [/audio/background](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/tree/master/audio) folder.
  - Add the license as a file according to documentation
- Add it to the API in the /js/sound.js file.

Expected Outcome:
- At least one merged pull request
- We can choose your music from the music menu.
- The license of the music is
  1. in the file next to the music so it belongs to the music file without doubt - same file name + `.license`
  2. added to the sound.js file so we can give credit to the artist while playing the music
- Issues resulting from your pull request are resolved: We tend to merge fast and allow others to build on your work. But we need to keep the project clean and working.

Hints:
- You can use the following open-source software:
  - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for recording
- For your own recodrings, we recommend choosing the license `CC-BY` or `CC-BY-SA` if you like others to remix or `CC-BY-ND` if you do not like people editing your song. Choose a license here: https://creativecommons.org/choose/ Please do not choose NC as this might disable it for GSoC.
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
