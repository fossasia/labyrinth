# Labyrinth: Add clues to lead to the various parts of the labyrinth !!

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game more interesting, please add a functionality to add music when the user enters a tile,

Requirements:
- In the `tiles.js` file edit the `alterInfo` tag of various tiles to lead the user to the various parts of the labyrinth (e.g. new year tile, etc)
- Note: the clues you give are logical and tangible
- The clues should lead to at-least a particular location(tile) in the Labyrinth
- The clues should be interesting (e.g. riddles, etc)

Expected Outcome:
- A merged pull request
- Added acceptable and tangible clues 

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
