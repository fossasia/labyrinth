# Labyrinth: Fix a bug

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
Please help us improve the game by removing a bug.

Requirements:
- Create or work on an  existing issue(Please take permission from the opener) to solve a bug in the site.
  These are different aspects which you can cover when you open an issue:
  - What problems does it cause?
  - What is needed to implement it?
  - How do you propose an implementation?
- Get feedback from one maintainer (Get the issue labeled as bug)
  or two other participants (they say this addition/PR is good for the game).
- Create at least one pull request to resolve the bug. 

Expected outcome:
- The issue is tagged as bug and resolved.
- There is at least one pull request by you which substantially helps resolve the issue.

Hints:
- You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
