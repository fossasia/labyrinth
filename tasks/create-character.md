# Labyrinth: Add a character

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. To allow players to choose between different characters, please add a character.

Requirements:
- Create an SVG or PNG character (200x200 pixels) for the game
- Add the character to the characters folder (/characters)
- Modify the gui file to prompt your character to be picked.
- The character MUST be your own work.

Expected Outcome:
- a merged pull request
- a new character is added to the game
- the character can be chosen to play with

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
