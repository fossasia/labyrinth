# Labyrinth: Add Music to Tiles

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game more interesting, please add music when the user enters a tile.

Requirements:
- Add the music with the relevant code changes to the [tiles.js](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/tiles.js) file.
- It must automatically play when the users enters, and stop when exiting.
- Please make sure to use the existing API, so it stops when exiting.
- It should be music relevant to the theme, try not to add any songs
- The music should be your own work. Please make sure you have the rights to any music that you add.

Expected Outcome:
- At least one merged pull request (link)
- Music is added to individual tile with the use of the API
- The tile is reachable and part of the labyrinth. (Help mentors review by adding the path to reach the tile.)
- The music is added according to documentation
  - /audio folder
  - license file
- Issues resulting from your pull request are resolved: We tend to merge fast and allow others to build on your work. But we need to keep the project clean and working.

Hints:
- You can use the following open-source software:
  - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for recording
- For your own recordings, we recommend choosing the license `CC-BY` or `CC-BY-SA` if you like others to remix or `CC-BY-ND` if you do not like people editing your song. Choose a license here: https://creativecommons.org/choose/ Please do not choose NC as this might disable it for GSoC.
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
