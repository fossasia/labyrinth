# Labyrinth: Add background music to tiles

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game more interesting, please add a functionality to add music when the user enters a tile,

Requirements:
- Add the music with the relevant code changes to the [tiles.js](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/tiles.js) file.
- It should automatically play when the users enters, and stop when exiting. 
- It should be music relevant to the theme, try not to add any songs
- Please make sure to use the existing API.
- The music should be your own work. Please make sure you have the rights to any music that you add.
- the music of any tile stops playing when the player leaves not moves
  choose the background music randomly
- add a loudness to the background music in the object you store it. Some music may be loud, some music is quite silent. If we add         music   from different people, we want to control that in the game as they make music of different volume.
  document different open-source software in the task that we can use.
  recording: audacity
- When all is done, we can create a new feature task to show a configuration menu for the two music types (on off/loudness)

Expected Outcome:
- A merged pull request
- Music is added to individual tile with the use of the API

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
