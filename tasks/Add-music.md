# Labyrinth: Add background music to tiles

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game more interesting, please add a functionality to add music when the user enters a tile,

Requirements:
- Add the music with the relevant code changes to the [tiles.js](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/tiles.js) file.
- It should automatically play when the users enters, and stop when exiting. 
- It should be music relevant to the theme, try not to add any songs
- Please make sure to use the existing API/

Expected Outcome:
- A merged pull request
- Music is added to individual tile with the use of the API

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
