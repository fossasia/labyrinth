# Labyrinth: Enhance the Documentation Engine (Advanced Task)

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To make the game development fast and more easy, build the documentation engine of the game / enhance the features/ add a new feature to the documentation engine.
The Documentation engine is proposed to render the documentation from static files onto a webpage backed by javascript.

Requirements
- Build the documentation engine 
- If the engine already exists, add a feature to it. (pagination/search etc)
- Write Documentation about any one API of the game and add it to the engine

Expected Outcome:
- a documentation engine which renders docs dynamically (with a new feature)
- a new API documentation added


Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
