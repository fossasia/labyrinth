# Labyrinth: Add a level

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
To extent the labyrinth, please add a new level.

Requirements:
- The level should be at least 7x7 tiles big. You do not need to create a compact level. You can also make long walks.
- The level is reachable by completing the level before.

Expected Outcome:
- A new level is added to the [levels.js](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/levels.js) file.
- players can reach the level and play it

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
