#Labyrinth: Create a Wall

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
As most of the tiles have the same walls and with same walls in every tile the game will look monotonous, please add more walls!

 Requirements:
- Download and install Inkscape from inkscape.org
- Create a wall for the Labyrinth maze 
- Add your wall to labyrinth/tiles/rooms/wall
- A merged pull request

 Expected outcome:
- Added atleast one wall
- The created wall should be a part of the labyrinth maze
- Issues based on the created PR must be resolved

 Hints:
- You can start with an existing wall or tile to get the placing and the dimensions.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
