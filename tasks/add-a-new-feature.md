# Labyrinth: Add a New Feature

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth.
We can add new features to the labyrinth which improve the game.

Requirements:
- Create an issue to discuss a new feature (Points System, Leaderboard, Multiplayer options and etc.).
  These are different aspects which you can cover:
  - Why this is needed, why it improves the game
  - What is needed to implement it
  - How you propose an implementation
- Get feedback from one maintainer (it is labeled as [new feature](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/labels/new%20feature))
  or two other participants (they say this feature is good for the game).
- Create at least one pull request to create the feature. 
- If other people collaborate with you, this is a sign the issue is descriptive.

Expected outcome:
- The issue is tagged as [new feature](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/labels/new%20feature) and resolved.
- The issue is resolved.
- There is at least one pull request by you which substantially helps resolve the issue.

Hints:
- You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
