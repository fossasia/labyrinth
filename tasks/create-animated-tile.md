# Labyrinth: Create an animated tile

The [FOSSASIA Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/) allows you to contribute parts to a huge labyrinth. Please, create a tile which is interactive. 

Requirements:

- Download and install [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/)
- Create a tile with the same dimensions as those which are there. Ways of his tile must end at the middle of the edges.
- Use CSS to animate the tile in a way: Bird flapping/oven cooking/water dropping, ... 
- While editing the game you may have ideas for improvement - add them as [github issue](https://github.com/fossasia/flappy-svg/issues).
- create a pull-request and have it merged and reviewed

Expected Outcome:
- An SVG tile was added to the [tiles folder](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/tree/master/tiles/)
- An implementation of that tile was added to the [tiles file](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth/blob/master/js/tiles.js)
- The tile is part of the [larger labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth) and reachable.

Hints:
- If someone wants to work with you, let them do that. You can use techniques like [pair programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) or collaborate together on branches of your forks. You can attribute a pull-request also to other people who helped you out or submit a pull-request where you and an other person contributed together.
- You can join our [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fossasia/labyrinth) if you get stuck to get help or just hang out and have a nice time with others.
