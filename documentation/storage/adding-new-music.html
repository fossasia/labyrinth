<h2>How to Add Music</h2>
<p>If you want to have a sound played when the character reaches your tile, your implementation must be something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">    visit: function() {
      playAudio(&quot;audio.mp3&quot;, licenseNum);
      // ...
     },
</code></pre>
<p>The license numbers are as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li>Attribution 4.0 International</li>
<li>Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International</li>
<li>Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International</li>
<li>Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International</li>
<li>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International</li>
<li>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</li>
</ol>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Note: if you are adding music to a tile then add it to: <code>audio/music</code> and if you are adding music as a background then add it to: <code>audio/background</code>! This is so that we can be organised and have a consistent filing system.</p>
<p>To add your audio file, please read the following carefully:<br>
Audio files are usually not licensed under AGPL. They have a different license.<br>
Please <strong>make sure that the license permits</strong> using the file for the project.<br>
Licenses which allow free usage are e.g. the Creative Commons Licenses: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, ... .<br>
To add a sound file, we need to respect the license, so please follow this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Add your sound file to the <a href="audio">audio</a> directory. Use a name which fits the sound.</li>
<li>[ ] Add a file with the license of the sound file. If your file is named <code>audio.mp3</code> add a file named <code>audio.mp3.license</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] If you created this sound, please consider adding the source files.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these two structures can exist in the audio folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single file with a license:<pre><code>audio/
+- sound.mp3
+- sound.mp3.license
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>A folder for many sound files with one license:<pre><code>audio/
+- source-name/
   +- LICENSE
   +- README.md
   +- sound1.mp3
   +- sound2.ogg
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you <strong>can</strong> have both audio and alert box in your tile as well.</p>
<p>If you want to add a background music, add your music to <code>audio/background/</code> in the same way.<br>
and update the <code>js/sound.js</code> file like so</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">const backgroundAudio = [
    {
        filename : &quot;Path of the file&quot;,
        backgroundSongName: &quot;Name of the song&quot;,
        author: &quot;Name of the author&quot;,
        legalNotice : &quot;Music by author&quot;,
        link : &quot;Link to author's website&quot;,
    },
];
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you comply with the way the person wants this song to be cited and add this to <code>legalNotice</code> in HTML format.<br>
This could be the same as the content of the license file for the file.</p>
