<h4>How to add new Characters</h4>
<p>Labyrinth allows you to add your characters by customizing the required javascript and svg files.</p><p>Currently the characters are svg images which are embedded into a div via javascript. Characters have a dimension of about 55 x 60 px (wxh)
Characters are present in the <code>characters</code> folder.</p><p>To create a character you may use an svg editor such as inkscape. However other photo editors and formats do work if they are imported into the editor
and saved as a svg file with the specified dimensions.</p><p>After creating characters add them to the <code>characters</code> folder.</p><p>Now, we will move on to the javascript part.
Each character has only difference in it's appearance and hence can be injected via putting its name and location to the svg file in <code>gui.js</code>.
Follow the format while adding to gui.js (To be precise add it to the swal box input values collection i.e, into the <code>inputOptionsPromise</code> variable
under the <code>resolve</code> sub class.)</p>
