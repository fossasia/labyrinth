What You Can Do anything with Our Sounds:
This is my recording of Schubert and Liszt's Der Muller und der Bach (The Miller and the Brook). It is also
on my YouTube channel (PianoDemos). This song can be used for whatever purpose, from background music in games
to soundtrack in animation. Note: this is not, and is not intended to be, a perfect rendition of the song.
